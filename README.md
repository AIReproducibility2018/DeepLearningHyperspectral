Deep learning-based classification of hyperspectral data

**The code in the src/ directory is predominately from the original authors of the mentioned paper.**

Some modifications to the code were necessary to make the code run, as well as in attempting to
improve the replication attempt.

See the companion-repository https://github.com/AIReproducibility2018/DLClassifHypspec for the changes made
to the code of the original authors, as well as resulting artefacts from the reproduction attempt.
