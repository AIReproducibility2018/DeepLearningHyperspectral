# DeepLearningHyperspectral


This repository contains code for attempting to reproduce the paper
 - [Deep Learning-Based Classification of Hyperspectral Data](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6844831)

**The code in the src/ directory is predominately from the original authors of the mentioned paper,
and originates from https://github.com/hantek/deeplearn_hsi .**

**IMPORTANT: The contents of the src/ directory are almost entirely unmodified from the code published by
the original paper authors, including the README.md file.
The README.md file in src/ also talks about reproducibility, but this is from the paper authors rather
than the actual replication attempt (which this parent directiory and parent README.md is part of)**

Some modifications to the code were necessary to make the code run, as well as in attempting to
improve the replication attempt.

See the companion-repository https://github.com/AIReproducibility2018/DLClassifHypspec for the changes made
to the code of the original authors, as well as resulting artefacts from the reproduction attempt.

The commit hash in the companion-repository is b824e17219cee03a35ce64ebdf8ea323daf1cf5c
